ELEC 681 Project: A Machine Learning Approach to WLAN Fingerprint based Localization

Automatic user localization consists of estimating the position of the user (latitude, longitude and altitude) by using an electronic device, usually a mobile phone. Outdoor localization problem can be solved very accurately thanks to the inclusion of GPS sensors into the mobile devices. However, indoor localization is still an open problem mainly due to the loss of GPS signal in indoor environments. Existing techniques exploit wireless signals in indoor environments to localize mobile devices. The key methodology is to calculate distance between wireless routers and mobile devices by exchange of packets, and then apply analytical and numerical methods to find the 3-d coordinates of the devices. In this project, we look at the localization problem with the constraint that there is no feedback between wireless devices i.e., passive sensing of wireless signal strength to find position of the sensing device.

To this end, we utilize the standard UJIInddorLoc database [1,2], consisting of 19937 training/reference records and 1111 validation/test records. Each Wi-Fi fingerprint record consists of user ID, timestamp, received signal strength intensity of 520 Access Points and location information including latitude, longitude, floor etc. We will compare state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in terms of positioning accuracy and computation time. Additionally, we will compare the performance of the best machine learning models with state-of-art indoor positioning records.
